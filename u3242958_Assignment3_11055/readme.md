Reflection

My design approach to this assignment was to create a functional and interactive website design. The website is modern and minimal featuring no
visual clutter, whilst being presentable and professional. Key features of the site include the interactable flip cards in the statistics
section and the image carousel at the bottom of the page. Elements on the page can interacted with through clicks which change the style of
the page, giving new information as shown through the addition of flip cards and the image carousel counting as a form of DOM manipulation activated
by mouse clicks. The design itself is quite simple but effective in its presentation of information where content is displayed in sections
ensures to not overwhelm the user. Imagery used in the website reinforces the nature and message of the site, where elements displayed are implemented
to provide a sense of scale.   

During the production process, I sought the help of tutorials from sites such as w3schools, and YouTube mainly. Whilst the links provided in
the university tutorials and modules helped me to understand the concepts at base level. Whilst the concepts were clear, incorporating them into
meaningful design was challenging, the DOM manipulation especially. As such whilst the website functions, not all elements have turned out the way they should have.
The navigation bar is not functioning as intended. Whilst the home button works as intended the other tabs do not. However, the display and 
breakdown of scroll position is working as intended. Some formatting is a bit off, with uneven spacing between content. The space separation
of background and summary are not equal to summary and event timeline. The formatting of the html is clean but could be improved and tidied up. There were some other
elements on the page that I wanted to include such as an animated graph. This would replace the flip cards and would create a better representation of the
statistics, but I ultimately decided to opt for the flip cards instead. However, I am still pleased with the look of the flip card functions, as they are
satisfying to use. Originally, I had included animated text that would fly on the screen from the side, however I removed it as it was too distracting and in combination of the
scroll to top feature accessed by the home tab it could make the website messy and unprofessional so I scrapped the idea. 

For my next project I would like to improve the structure and formatting of the site, improving on the formatting of the site. Neat and even spaced content as well as the inclusion
of a responsive nav - shrinking or resizing the window creates a hamburger drop down menu and changing the formatting of content when viewed on smaller screens. When shrunken the content moves 
beyond the boundaries instead of formatting to the size, I would like to change this in future projects as it is necessary and good for user experience. I hope to get more familiar with Javascript concepts as they still confuse me, as I enjoy creating sites.
